 Since I have no idea how to get it to run on a website, please use the BigTwo.exe that should also be in the repository to play/test

 This project is a game of BigTwo, or 大老二. It is a very popular game in East Asia. 
 At the beginning of each game, the player with the 3♦ starts by playing it singly or as part of a combination.
 The combinations are essentially Poker Hands. Search them up if you aren't a gambling person. 
 Each subsequent player must play a higher card or combination than the one before, with the same number of cards. 
 Players may pass their turn, meaning they choose not to play or they do not have the cards to make a play.
 When all but one of the players have passed in succession, the turn is over and cards that were played remain in a waste-pile. 
 A new turn is started with all players, initiated by the last player to play.
 The game ends when one player has played all of the cards in their hand.

 Note: Since this is a very popular game, there are many versions of it. 
 For mine, I have the suits smallest to largest clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades and you can only play 1, 2, or 5 cards at once.
 Also, here 2 can only be the largest card, so it cannot be part of straight like Ace 2 3 4 5
 3 of a kind do not exist in mine either, unless in a full house. You can play a four of a kind with one other random card.
